PyHiero is a pure python bitmap font engine that can parse bitmap font files as generated by [Hiero](http://slick.cokeandcode.com/demos/hiero.jnlp) from the [SlicK](http://slick.cokeandcode.com/) game engine. 

Although library-independent, it includes a rendering engine for [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) that is compatible with its [pygame.font.Font](http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/font.html#pygame.font.Font) class in that it can be used in advanced text rendering libraries such as [Glyph](http://code.google.com/p/glyph/) for extra awesomeness.  

## Dependencies
* Python (tested with 2.7, should also work with 3.x)
* pygame (only if you want to use the PyGameHieroFont class)

## Getting Started
Check out the demo.py in the root directory.
